This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 


```{r}
#in order to run this code, you will need to install these packages. You can do so by going to the install button, or by going to the console and typing, for example, install.packages("knitr")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr)) #makes pdfs
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(latex2exp))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse)) #good library for data manipulation, includes dplyr and ggplot
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(retrosheet))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(Lahman))

# you can read more about the tidyverse at: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
#require(retrosheet)
```

The line below obtains all the the 
```{r}
rs2009 = getRetrosheet("", 2009)
```

Let's extract the first game of the season for the SF Giants
```{r}
first_game = rs2009[1]

## Data Exploration

Let's look at the State Frequency:


```{r}
data("Batting")

# Calculate the historical average of hits
average_hits <- Batting %>%
  group_by(yearID) %>%
  summarise(average_hits = mean(H, na.rm = TRUE))  # Assuming 'H' represents hits in the dataset

# Plotting the historical average of hits
ggplot(average_hits, aes(x = yearID, y = average_hits)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Historical Average of Hits",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Average Hits")


```


```{r}
values <- c(0.02, 0.06, 0.14, 0.47, 0.22, 0.66, 0.63, 0.9, 0.02, 0.07, 0.17, 0.49, 0.27, 0.6, 0.56, 0.83, 0.02, 0.08, 0.2, 0.24, 0.27, 0.32, 0.37, 0.59)

# Number of rows and columns for your matrix
num_rows <- 3
num_cols <- 8


# Create a matrix
my_matrix <- matrix(values, nrow = num_rows, ncol = num_cols)

# Display a heatmap
heatmap(my_matrix, 
        main = "Heatmap Example",
        xlab = "Columns",
        ylab = "Rows",
        col = heat.colors(10),  # You can customize the color palette
        scale = "none"          # You can adjust the scaling if needed
)
