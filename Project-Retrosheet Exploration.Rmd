This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#in order to run this code, you will need to install these packages. You can do so by going to the install button, or by going to the console and typing, for example, install.packages("knitr")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr)) #makes pdfs
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(latex2exp))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse)) #good library for data manipulation, includes dplyr and ggplot
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(retrosheet))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(Lahman))

# you can read more about the tidyverse at: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
